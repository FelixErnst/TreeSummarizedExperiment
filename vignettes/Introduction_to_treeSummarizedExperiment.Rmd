# Introduction 

The `treeSummarizedExperiment` class is an extensions of the
`SummarizedExperiment` class. It's used to store rectangular data of
experimental results as in a `SummarizedExperiment`, and also support the
storage of a hierarchical structure and its link information to the rectangular
data. 

# treeSummarizedExperiment {#tse-class}

## Anatomy of treeSummarizedExperiment

```{r strTSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "The structure of the treeSummarizedExperiment class."}
knitr::include_graphics("tse.png")
```
Compared with the `SummarizedExperiment` class, there are two more slots, the
tree data (`treeData`) and the link data (`linkData`), in the
`treeSummarizedExperiment` class. Other slots, including `assays`, `rowData`,
`colData` and `metadata`, are the same as those in `SummarizedExperiment`.


## Toy data
We generate a *toyTable* with observations of 5 entities collected from 4
samples.
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(TreeSummarizedExperiment)
    library(S4Vectors)
    library(ggtree)
    library(ape)})

# assays data
set.seed(1)
toyTable <- matrix(rnbinom(20, size = 1, mu = 10), nrow = 5)
colnames(toyTable) <- paste(rep(LETTERS[1:2], each = 2), 
                            rep(1:2, 2), sep = "_")
rownames(toyTable) <- paste("entity", seq_len(5), sep = "")

toyTable
```

Descriptions of the `r nrow(toyTable)` entities and `r ncol(toyTable)`
samples are given in the *rowInf* and *colInf*, respectively.
```{r}
# row data
rowInf <- DataFrame(var1 = sample(letters[1:2], 5, replace = TRUE),
                    var2 = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5, replace = TRUE),
                    row.names = rownames(toyTable))
rowInf
# column data
colInf <- DataFrame(gg = c(1, 2, 3, 3),
                    group = rep(LETTERS[1:2], each = 2), 
                    row.names = colnames(toyTable))
colInf
```

The hierarchical structure of the 5 entities is denoted as *toyTree*. We create
it by using the function `rtree` from the package `r CRANpkg("ape")`. It's a
`phylo` object.
```{r}
# create a toy tree
set.seed(1)
toyTree <- rtree(5)
class(toyTree)
```

As we see, the `phylo` object is actually a list of four elements.
```{r tree, fig.cap="\\label{tree} The structure of the tree"}
str(toyTree)
ggtree(toyTree) +
geom_text2(aes(label = node), color = "darkblue",
                hjust = -0.5, vjust = 0.7) +
geom_text2(aes(label = label), color = "darkorange",
            hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.7)
```


## The construction of treeSummarizedExperiment

To store the toy data, *toyTable*, *rowInf*, *colInf*, and *toyTree*, we could
use a `treeSummarizedExperiment` container. To correctly store data, we need to additionally provide the link information between the rows of *toyTable* and the nodes of the *toyTree* via a column `nodeLab` in `rowData`.

```{r}
# add a column (nodeLab) to the row data
rowInf$nodeLab <- toyTree$tip.label
lse <- treeSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable),
                                rowData = rowInf,
                                colData = colInf,
                                tree = toyTree)
lse
```

```{r}
assays(lse)[[1]]
```


## Data aggregation {#agg}

To aggregate data to a specific level of the tree, the function `nodeValue`
could be used. The output of `nodeValue` is still a `treeSummarizedExperiment` object.
The argument `fun` specifies how the value at an internal node is calculated
from its descendant nodes. Here, the `sum` is used, and thus the value for each
node is equal to the sum of the values of all its descendants. To view the
running process, `message = TRUE` is used.

To aggregate data to all internal nodes of the tree.
```{r}
tse <- nodeValue(data = lse, fun = sum, message = FALSE)
```

Now the assays table has more rows that are for internal nodes.
```{r}
assays(tse)[[1]] 
```

The link data is automatically updated.
```{r}
linkData(tse)
```

To aggregate data to a specific level of the tree, e.g. the node 7 (see Figure
\@ref(fig:tree)).
```{r}
test1 <- nodeValue(data = lse, fun = sum, message = FALSE, level = 7)

# or the leaf t3
test2 <- nodeValue(data = lse, fun = sum, message = FALSE, level = c("t3"))
```

## Data aggregation based on taxonomic table
For users want to use a taxonomic table to do aggregation, it's a special case
of previous section, and could be done as below.
```{r}
# a taxonomic table 
taxTab <- data.frame(R1 = rep("A", 5), 
                     R2 = c("B1", rep("B2", 4)),
                     R3 = c("C1", "C2", "C3", "C3", "C4"),
                     R4 = c("D1", "D2", "D3", "D4", "D5"))
rownames(taxTab) <- taxTab$R4
# recreate the TreeSummarizedExperiment using a different tree
taxTree <- toTree(data = data.frame(taxTab))
rowInf$nodeLab <- taxTree$tip.label
taxLse <- treeSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable),
                                rowData = rowInf,
                                colData = colInf,
                                tree = taxTree)
linkData(taxLse)


```

Aggregate to a specific level, e.g. R2.
```{r}
# nodes that belong to R1 level
lab <- c(taxTree$tip.label, taxTree$node.label)
bi <- lab[grep("R2", lab)]
test3 <- nodeValue(data = taxLse, fun = sum, level = bi)
```

Aggregate to a specific node, e.g. C3.
```{r}
# the node labels
test4 <- nodeValue(data = taxLse, fun = sum, level = "R3 - C3")
assays(test4)[[1]]
```


## Change `phyloseq` object to `TreeSummarizedExperiment`

```{r eval=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(phyloseq)})

# load the phyloseq object
data("GlobalPatterns")
dat <- GlobalPatterns
GP <- treeSummarizedExperiment(tree = phy_tree(dat),
                               assays = list(otu_table(dat)@.Data),
                               rowData = tax_table(dat)@.Data,
                               colData = data.frame(sample_data(dat)))
```

## The accessor functions
### Assays
To extract a table in `assays` from `treeSummarizedExperiment` object, we could
use the `assays` accessor function. This is similar to the
`SummarizedExperiment` class.

```{r}
(aData <- assays(tse)[[1]])
```

We could use the node labels from the link data (\@ref(sec:linkData)) as the row
names via the argument `use.nodeLab = TRUE`. Commonly, the column `nodeLab` is
used as the row names. However, if it has duplicated values, the column
`nodeLab_alias` is used.

```{r}
assays(tse, use.nodeLab = TRUE)[[1]] 
```

The value at each node (from sample *A_1*) could be visualized with the
following figure. We see that the value at each internal node is the sum of
those at its descendant leaves.  More details about how to use 
`r Biocpkg("ggtree")` to plot the tree could be seen
[here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html).
```{r}
# load packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(ggtree)  # to plot the tree
    })

# extract a sample column from assays 
ex1 <- assays(tse)[[1]][, 1, drop = FALSE]

# combine it with the data extracted from linkData
# rename column nodeNum as node
# optional : datF <- cbind.data.frame(ex1, linkData(tse)) %>%
# rename(node=nodeNum)
datF <- cbind.data.frame(ex1, linkData(tse)) 
colN <- colnames(datF)
colN[colN == "nodeNum"] <- "node"
colnames(datF) <- colN

# plot
ggtree(treeData(tse)) %<+% datF +
  geom_text2(aes(label = A_1), color = "brown1", size = 8)
```

The data *datF* is used to annotate the tree via `%<+%` (see `?"%<+%")

### Row data, column data and metadata 

The row data, column data, and metadata could be accessed exactly as in the
`SummarizedExperiment` class.

```{r}
(rData <- rowData(tse))
```

The column `nodeLab` is now moved to the `linkData` (see Section
\@ref(sec:linkData)), and isn't in the `rowData` (*rData*) of
`treeSummarizedExperiment` anymore.

```{r}
(cData <- colData(tse))
```

```{r}
# It is empty in the metadata
(mData <- metadata(tse))
```

### Link data {#sec:linkData}

The `linkData()` accessor is used to view the link information between rows of
matrix-like elements in the `assays` and nodes of the tree. 
```{r}
(linkD <- linkData(tse))
```
Rows of the link data are one-to-one mapped to rows of the matrix-like element
in `assays`. Their orders are exactly the same.  Each row of the matrix-like
element in `assays` could be mapped to a node of the tree, whose label and
number are in the column *nodeLab* and *nodeNum*, respectively. The column
*isLeaf* gives information whether a node is a leaf node. The column *rowID*
contains the corresponding row number in `assays`.

If the labels of nodes are available and unique on the tree, the link data would
have 4 columns including *nodeLab*, *nodeNum*, *isTip*, and *rowID*; otherwise,
it would have one additonal column *nodeLab_alias*.

As shown in the Figure \@ref(fig:toyTREE), the tree we have used has no labels 
(orange text) for internal nodes.

### Tree data

The tree structure could be accessed using `treeData()`. It is a `phylo` object. 
```{r}
treeD <- treeData(tse)
class(treeD)
```

The figure of the tree structure is shown in the Figure \@ref(fig:toyTREE). The
node label is given in orange text, and the node number is in blue.
```{r toyTREE, fig.cap="Rectangular layout of toyTree."}
ggtree(treeD) + 
    geom_text2(aes(label = label), color = "darkorange", 
               hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.7, size = 6) +
    geom_text2(aes(label = node), color = "darkblue", 
               hjust = -0.5, vjust = 0.7, size = 5)
```

## Node search

In our application, we aggregate the data to all levels (nodes) of the tree and
perform analysis that would finally return a score. The work of our interest is
to find out the branch (or internal) node that has a local lower score value. In
other words, the node(s) that has lower score value than any of its descendant
nodes, and the score value is also below 0.05. (node 5, 10 and 14). The scores
of nodes are in orange texts and the corresponding node numbers (or label) are
in blue.


```{r }
set.seed(1)
score <- sample(1:19, 19)/100

exTree <- ape::rtree(10)

# annotate the tree nodes in figure
df <- data.frame(score = score, node = 1:19)
ggtree(exTree) %<+% df + 
    geom_text2(aes(label = node), color = "darkblue", 
               hjust = - 0.1, vjust = 0.7, size = 6) +
    geom_text2(aes(label = score), color = "darkorange", 
               hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.7, size = 5) +
    geom_point2(aes(subset = node %in% c( 5, 10, 14)),
                size = 4, color = "cyan", alpha = 0.7)
```

We expect the `TreeSummarizedExperiment` class could be flexible enough to be
extended to this application.
