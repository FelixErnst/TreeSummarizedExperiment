# Introduction 

The `TreeSummarizedExperiment` class is an extensions of the
`SummarizedExperiment` class. It's used to store rectangular data of
experimental results as in a `SummarizedExperiment`, and also support the
storage of a hierarchical structure and its link information to the rectangular
data. 

# TreeSummarizedExperiment {#tse-class}

## Anatomy of TreeSummarizedExperiment

```{r strTSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "The structure of the TreeSummarizedExperiment class."}
knitr::include_graphics("tse.png")
```
Compared with the `SummarizedExperiment` class, `TreeSummarizedExperiment` has
one more slot, `treeData`, to store the hierarchical structures (or tree) of the
rows and columns (or one of them) of the `assays` tables. The link information
between the `assays` tables and the tree is referred as `linkData`. It is stored
as the left part of the `rowData` (`colData`) if the hierarchical structure of
the rows is available on the `rowTree` (`colTree`)  of `treeData`; the right
part of the `rowData` (`colData`) is the traditional `rowData` (`colData`) in
`SummarizedExperiment`. Other slots, including `assays` and `metadata`, are the
same as those in `SummarizedExperiment`.


## Toy data
We generate a **toyTable** with observations of 5 entities collected from 4
samples.
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(TreeSummarizedExperiment)
    library(S4Vectors)
    library(ggtree)
    library(ape)})

# assays data
set.seed(1)
toyTable <- matrix(rnbinom(20, size = 1, mu = 10), nrow = 5)
colnames(toyTable) <- paste(rep(LETTERS[1:2], each = 2), 
                            rep(1:2, 2), sep = "_")
rownames(toyTable) <- paste("entity", seq_len(5), sep = "")

toyTable
```

The descriptions of the `r nrow(toyTable)` entities and `r ncol(toyTable)`
samples are given in the **rowInf** and **colInf**, respectively.
```{r}
# row data
rowInf <- DataFrame(var1 = sample(letters[1:2], 5, replace = TRUE),
                    var2 = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5, replace = TRUE),
                    row.names = rownames(toyTable))
rowInf
# column data
colInf <- DataFrame(gg = c(1, 2, 3, 3),
                    group = rep(LETTERS[1:2], each = 2), 
                    row.names = colnames(toyTable))
colInf
```

The hierarchical structure of the `r nrow(toyTable)` entities is denoted as **treeR**. The hierarchical structure of the `r ncol(toyTable)` samples is denoted as **treeC**. We create
them by using the function `rtree` from the package `r CRANpkg("ape")`. 
```{r}
# Toy tree 1
set.seed(1)
treeR <- rtree(5)
class(treeR)

# Toy tree 2
set.seed(4)
treeC <- rtree(4)
treeC$tip.label <- colnames(toyTable)
treeC$node.label <- c("All", "GroupA", "GroupB")
```

The created trees are `phylo` objects. The `phylo` object is actually a list of
four elements.
```{r}
class(treeR)
str(treeR)
```

More details about how to use `r Biocpkg("ggtree")` to visualize the tree could
be seen [here](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html).

```{r rtree, fig.cap="\\label{rtree} The structure of the row tree"}
# Visualize the row tree
ggtree(treeR, size = 2) +
geom_text2(aes(label = node), color = "darkblue",
                hjust = -0.5, vjust = 0.7, size = 6) +
geom_text2(aes(label = label), color = "darkorange",
            hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.7, size = 6)


```

```{r ctree, fig.cap="\\label{ctree} The structure of the column tree"}
# Visualize the column tree
ggtree(treeC, size = 2) +
geom_text2(aes(label = node), color = "darkblue",
                hjust = -0.5, vjust = 0.7, size = 6) +
geom_text2(aes(label = label), color = "darkorange",
            hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.7, size = 6)
```

## The construction of `TreeSummarizedExperiment

We could use a `TreeSummarizedExperiment` container to store the toy data:
**toyTable**, **rowInf**, **colInf**, **treeC** and **treeR**, To correctly
store data, the link information between the rows of **toyTable** and the nodes
of the **treeR** is requried to provide via a column `nodeLab`. The same
requirement is applied to the link between the columns and **treeC**. Those
columns or rows that don't match with the tree structure are removed.

If the tree structure is available on the rows of `assays` tables, we could
construct the  `TreeSummarizedExperiment` object as below. The tree **treeR** is
stored in the `treeData` slot via the argument `rowTree`.
```{r}
# add a column (nodeLab) to the row data 
rowInf$nodeLab <- c(treeR$tip.label)

rse <- TreeSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable),
                                rowData = rowInf,
                                colData = colInf,
                                rowTree = treeR)
rse
```

If the tree is on the columns of `assays` table, we could store it via the
argument `colTree`. Here, the **tse** contains a tree on rows (**treeR**) and a
tree on columns (**treeC**). If the row names match the labels used for the
nodes of the tree, we could omit the step of adding the column `nodeLab`.
```{r}
## omit this step
# add a column (nodeLab) to the column data;
# colInf$nodeLab <- treeC$tip.label

rownames(colInf)
treeC$tip.label

tse <- TreeSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable),
                                rowData = rowInf,
                                colData = colInf,
                                rowTree = treeR,
                                colTree = treeC)
tse
```

As the results shown above, **rse** has one row tree, and **tse** has two trees:
one on rows and the other on columns.



## The accessor functions
### Assays and metadata

To extract `assays` tables or `metadata`, it's exactly the same as
the `SummarizedExperiment` class.

```{r}
# to get the first table in the assays
(count <- assays(tse)[[1]])
```


```{r}
# to get metadata: it's empty here
(mdata <- metadata(tse))
```

### Row data, column 

The row data and column data could be accessed via `rowData` and `colData`,
respectively. This is also the same as the work on the `SummarizedExperiment`
class. The difference is on the results. If the `TreeSummarizedExperiment` has a
tree structure on the rows of `assays` tables, the `rowData` would be a
`LinkDataFrame` class instead of the `DataFrame` class. The `LinkDataFrame`
contains a two-part data separated by a vertical line. An example is shown below.

```{r}
(rData <- rowData(tse))
```

The left part is the link data and the right part is the standard row data seen
in the  `SummarizedExperiment` class. The link data has 4 columns: **nodeLab**,
**nodeLab\_alias**, **nodeNum**, and **isLeaf**.

* nodeLab The labels of nodes on the tree
* nodeLab\_alias The alias labels of nodes on the tree
* nodeNum The numbers of nodes on the tree
* isLeaf It's to indicate whether the node is a leaf node

Users are allowed to change the standard part (metadata) of the row data and
column data, but not the link data. 
```{r}
# overwrite the column var1 with uppercase letters
rowData(tse)$var1 <- toupper(rowData(tse)$var1)
rowData(tse)

# add a new column
rowData(tse)$new <- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2)
rowData(tse)
```


To obtain the **linkData**, the function `linkData` could be used.
```{r}
# the link data on the rows
(lrData <- linkData(tse, onRow = TRUE))
```


To obtain the right part of the row data, the function `metaCol` could be used.
```{r}
# the meta data on the rows
(rrData <- metaCol(tse, onRow = TRUE))
```


The similar work could be applied to the column data.
```{r}
# the column data
(cData <- colData(tse))

# the link data on the columns
(lcData <- linkData(tse, onRow = FALSE))

# the meta data on the columns
(rcData <- metaCol(tse, onRow = FALSE))
```


## The subseting function

We could use `[` to subset the `TreeSummarizedExperiment`. To keep tracking from
the original data, the 'treeData` doesn't change in the subsetting.

```{r}
tse1 <- tse[1:2, 1]
tse1
```

The row data and column data are changed accordingly.
```{r}
rowData(tse1)
```

```{r}
colData(tse1)
```


# Aggregation

The aggregation is allowed both on the row and the column dimension.

## The column dimension

Here, we show the aggregation on the column dimension. The
`TreeSummarizedExperiment` object is assigned to the argument `x`. The desired
aggregation level is given in `colLevel`. The level could be specified via the
node label (the orange texts in Figure \@ref(fig:ctree)) or the node number (the
blue texts in Figure \@ref(fig:ctree)). We could further decide how to aggregate
via the argument `FUN`.

```{r}
aggCol <- aggValue(x = tse, colLevel = c("GroupA", "GroupB"), FUN = sum)

# or
aggCol <- aggValue(x = tse, colLevel = c(6, 7), FUN = sum)
```


```{r}
assays(aggCol)[[1]]
```

The `rowData` doesn't change, but the `colData` adjusts with the change of the
\code{assays} table. For example, the column **group** has the `A` value for
`GroupA` because the descendant nodes of `GroupA` all have the value `A`; the
column **gg** has the `NA` value for `GroupA` because the descendant nodes of
`GroupA` have different values, (1 and 2).
```{r}
# before aggregation
colData(tse)

# after aggregation
colData(aggCol)
```

## The row dimension

It's similar to the aggregation on the row dimension, except that the level
should be specified via `rowLevel`.


```{r}
aggRow <- aggValue(x = tse, rowLevel = 7:9, FUN = sum)
```

Now, the output `assays` table has 3 rows. There is no row names for the table
because there is no labels for the specified level (`rowLevel`) of the tree.
From the `LinkData` of the output row data, we could know which row corresponds
to which nodes.

```{r}
assays(aggRow)[[1]]
rowData(aggRow)
```


The aggregation on both row and column dimensions could be performed as below.
```{r}
aggBoth <- aggValue(x = tse, colLevel = c(6, 7), 
                    rowLevel = 7:9, FUN = sum)
```

As expected, we obtain a table with 3 rows (`rowLevel = 7:9`) and 2 columns
(`colLevel = c(6, 7)`).
```{r}
assays(aggBoth)[[1]]
```

From the Figure \@ref(fig:rtree), we could see that the nodes 7, 8 and 9  have
no labels. Therefore, the `nodeLab` column in `LinkData` of the row data has
missing value. They are all internal nodes and hence the column `isLeaf` has
only the `FALSE` value.
```{r}
rowData(aggBoth)
```


From the Figure \@ref(fig:rtree), we could see that the nodes 6 and 7 are
labelled with `GroupA` and `GroupB`, respectively. This agrees with the
`LinkData` of the column data.
```{r}
colData(aggBoth)
```

# Aggregation on the taxonomic table

In some case, the information of the hierarchical structure is available as a
`data.frame` instead of the `phylo` object mentioned above. To do the work
listed above, we could convert the `data.frame` to the `phylo` class.

The function `toTree` outputs the hierarchical information into a `phylo`
object. If the data set is large, we suggest to allow `cache = TRUE` to speed up
the aggregation step.

```{r}
# The toy taxonomic table
taxTab <- data.frame(Kindom = rep("A", 5),
                     Phylum = c("B1", rep("B2", 4)),
                     Class = c("C1", "C2", "C3", "C3", NA),
                     OTU = c("D1", "D2", "D3", "D4", NA))

# convert to a phylo tree
taxTree <- toTree(data = taxTab, cache = FALSE)

ggtree(taxTree)+
geom_text2(aes(label = node), color = "darkblue",
                hjust = -0.5, vjust = 0.7, size = 6) +
geom_text2(aes(label = label), color = "darkorange",
            hjust = -0.1, vjust = -0.7, size = 6)
```


```{r}
# construct a TreeSummarizedExperiment object
rowInf$nodeLab <- taxTree$tip.label
taxTSE <- TreeSummarizedExperiment(assays = list(toyTable),
                                   rowData = rowInf,
                                   rowTree = taxTree)

```

Here is about how to aggregate to the phylum level.
```{r}
# specify the level
taxLab <- c(taxTree$tip.label, taxTree$node.label)
ii <- startsWith(taxLab, "Phylum:") 
l1 <- taxLab[ii]

# aggregate
aggTAX <- aggValue(x = taxTSE, rowLevel = l1, FUN = sum)

```


```{r}
assays(aggTAX)[[1]]
```

```{r}
rowData(aggTAX)
```


The aggregation could be on any freely combined level.
```{r}
# specify the level
l2 <- c("Class:C3", "Phylum:B1")

# aggregate
aggF <- aggValue(x = taxTSE, rowLevel = l2, FUN = sum)

```


```{r}
assays(aggF)[[1]]
```

```{r}
rowData(aggF)
```
